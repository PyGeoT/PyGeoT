**PyGeoT** is a script written in Python language that automates the use of GeoT and iGeoT softwares, performing pre- and post-processing input and ouput files, runs extensive sensitivity analysis, filters results to ease the post-processing of the data, and provides a graph synthesizing the obtained results.
This script is useful because the ability of PyGeoT to test many mineral assemblages and select a set of minerals to compute a reservoir temperature lets the users eliminate the exhaustive effort of manually examining these assemblages. Also, the statistical and visual analysis of the mineral combinations are facilitated by the post-processing capacity of PyGeoT. 
To run PyGeoT is required to have a GeoT/iGeoT licence, a text file with the chemical composition of the water samples that will be analyzed, a thermodynamic database, and Python 3.7. 
PyGeoT was developed as a Ph.D. project from CICESE. When you use it, please cite as Olguín-Martínez et al., 2022.
