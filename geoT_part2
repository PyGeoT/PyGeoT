# ######## MINERALS
# name:  mineral name
# iflag:  blank (default no reaction) or 1 to react mineral with solution (full reaction to equilibrium)
# slqk:  desired log(Q/K) for reaction (only when iflag=1; leave blank or zero for equilibrium)
#
# Always end the list of minerals with a star (in quotes or not) even if no minerals are listed
# If no minerals are given all possible minerals from the database will be considered in T estimations (not recommended)
# T estimations are computed using the "min_elim" number of minerals that cluster the best at any T (min_elim is entered further below)
# Optional entries as follow (either separately or both options together but must be in order shown!):
#    - first mineral entry = "include_minerals": all minerals from the database will be considered but the
#       minerals listed in subsequent records will always be included in T estimations regardless if they cluster or not (list must end with '*')
#    - first mineral entry = "skip_minerals": all minerals from the database will be considered but the minerals listed
#      in subsequent records will be excluded in T estimations (list must end with '*')
