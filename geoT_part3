######### GASES - always end the list with a star (in quotes or not) even if no gases are listed
#
# name:  gas name (H2O must come first)
# conc:  For H2O (first record): mole frac in wet gas
#        For other gases (list after H2O): dry gas composition (mol%)
#   Optional: leave conc blank to include gases in speciation calcs (output partial pressure etc.)
#                    without adding the gas composition into solution
#
# log_fug: if not blank the gas fugacity will remain fixed at the log10(fugacity) value entered )

######## PRINT FLAGS
# iprt-spc 0 prints full speciation at initial T only but not the initial speciation after addition of gases
#          1 prints full speciation at initial T for both no-gas and added-gas cases
#          2 prints full speciation at tincp temperature intervals
# tincp:  T increment at which to output data (must be greater or equal to tinc defined below)
#
# iprt_final:  0 or blank (default no effect)
#              1 results in one additional (final) speciation calculation and T estimation with the
#                reconstructed water (output in files  xxx_final.xxx). This option is only useful when minerals
#                are reacted or when minerals are used to fixed the activity of a species.

######## GEOTHERMOMETRY FLAGS
# geot: "yes" for calcs "no" to skip
# tstart tend:  starting and ending T for saturation indices and geothermometry calculations (typically 100 and 300C)
# tinc:   T increment at which to evaluate saturation indices
# min_elim: if min_elim >3 the list of minerals from which to infer temperature will be narrowed to the first min_elim number of
#          minerals that cluster the best (suggested 10)
# iscale: 0 no scaling of saturation indices
#         1 scale saturation indices of silicates to 1x silica (suggested)
#         2 scale saturation indices of all minerals by molecular weight/100
