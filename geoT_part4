######## WATER COMPOSITIONS
# ID:    40-character water ID
# tc:    initial speciation temperature in (C)
# keepic: unused
#
# stwf:  =0.0 no gas is added back into solution (no degassing correction)
#        >0.0 and <1.0  steam (total gases) weight fraction in total discharge (for degassing corrections)
#        >=1.0 sampling pressure in bar - in this case stwf is computed iteratively assuming isoenthalpic boiling
# cfact: concentration factor  (1=no concentration > 1 for concentr < 1 for dilution)
#          (multiplies input concentrations)
# soldens (V1.5 and above):  solution density for concentration unit conversions in g/cc = kg/l - defaults to 1
#
# pmix:  Advanced use only: mixing proportions for each mixing endmembers (0 or blank =none 2 = 2:1 mixing etc)
#        enter one pmix per mixing waters
# name:   name of primary species (at minimum H+ and H2O) - any order
# icon: 1 input concentration is total moles (for water total kg generally 1kg)
#       2 constrained by equilibrium with specified mineral at given log(Q/K) but only at initialization temperature tc
#       3 input concentration is activity (e.g. use for pH) (only at initialization temperature tc)
#       4 input concentration will be adjusted for charge balance (at all temperatures)
#         (!!! if the species charge sign is the same as the charge imbalance will not converge - then pick a species with opposite charge)
#       5 constrained by equilibrium with specified mineral at given log(Q/K) but only at T=tstart and above (to avoid convergence problems at low T)
#       6 constrained by equilibrium with specified mineral at given log(Q/K) at all temperatures
#       7 input concentration is activity (e.g. use for pH) remains fixed at all temperatures
# trial_c: initial guess for NR iterations (generally use same as input molalities)
#          (affects initial speciation convergence but does not affect results)
# input_c:  moles of dissolved species and kg of water
#         V1.5 and above: other concentrations units can be entered if followed by the following strings
#              (note case insensitive quotes are required if units contains a "/")
#               ppm  ppb mgl ugl molar mmolar umolar molal mmolal umolal 'mg/L'  'ug/L'  'mmol/kg'  'umol/kg'  'mmol/L'  'umol/L'
#               By default mass units are converted using the molecular weight of the primary species
#               unless the element is specified as follows e.g.:  200 ppm as Si   (the "as" is required)
#
# name_eq: name of mineral fixing the concentration of that species (enabled when icon=2)
# logqk:    desired saturation index of constraining mineral (enabled when icon=2)
#
